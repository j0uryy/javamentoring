## Notes

- Remember to update your pycharm and python.
- Make sure to use "New UI" option in pycharm.
- Make sure you use english while working in git.
- Make sure to use english names for variables, functions etc.
- Make sure to use snake case.
- Don't overcomplicate variable names, something like `def check_if_name_is_proper()` won't pass review.
- Use refactor instead of renaming every single variable, function, name as it is very helpful. This way you won't miss any occurrence of a given thing.
- Make sure to use keyboard shortcuts, even if u struggle at first, as they greatly increase your efficiency.
- If you need user input at the beginning of your code, don't use input. Instead use command line arguments.
  - With that being said, start using cmd to run your scripts.
  - If you feel comfortable enough, we can set you up linux vm without GUI so you can learn more.
- Document your code, I expect `README.md` in each separate directory.
- Make sure you know what every single line in your code does.
- DO NOT ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS. If you come up with something yourself, you'll remember it better.
- DO NOT GIVE UP. With enough work, you can even surpass me in skill.
